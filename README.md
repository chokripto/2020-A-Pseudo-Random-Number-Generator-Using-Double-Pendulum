# 2020-A-Pseudo-Random-Number-Generator-Using-Double-Pendulum

Chaos in the double pendulum motion has been proved in several studies. Despite this useful cryptographic propriety, this
system has not been applied to cryptography yet. This paper presents a new pseudo random number generator based on a double
pendulum. Randomness of the numbers generated by the proposed generator is successfully tested by NIST and DIEHARDER tests.
The results of the security analysis asserted the appropriateness of the new generator for cryptographic applications.
